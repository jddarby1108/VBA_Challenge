# VBA_Challenge
Attached Module1 for VBA_Challenge with full code through Challenge executed
  Code takes quite a bit of time to run (~15 mins with my processor), I expect due to placement of some to the calculations.
    What I learned? Indention key, better understanding of loops, data errors driven by dividing by zero and much more!!!
    Also, I can't wait for Python.

Attached 3 screen shots for each year's calculations
Thanks! Jennifer
